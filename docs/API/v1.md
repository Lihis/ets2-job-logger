# API v1

This document contains details and endpoints of API version `1`.

All payloads are sent with `POST` request to URL in form of
`<API_URL>/<ENDPOINT>`.

## Capabilities

This endpoint, `<API_URL>/capabilities`, is used to query the server of its
capabilities, i.e. which endpoints it supports. This is queried when program
starts or if user changes settings.

Expected HTTP response code `200`. Program will not send anything to the API
until the capabilities has been successfully queried. Query can fail because
of server did not return HTTP code `200` or the received JSON was invalid.

Configurable endpoints and example of JSON which server is expected to return:

```
{
    "truck": true                 // Supports Truck -endpoint (default: false)
    "fine": true                  // Supports Fine -endpoint (default: false)
}
```

JSON can be minified and keys with default values can be omitted if you want
to use the default value.

## Job

Jobs will be sent to `<API_URL>/job` when user takes a job or cancels or
delivers it.

Expected HTTP response code `200`. Otherwise, payload sending will be retried
in 30 seconds intervals until API responds with HTTP code `200`.

Below is an example of JSON format for a job.

**Notes:**

- If `isSpecial` is `true` then `company` object in `source` and
  `destination` will not exist.
- Truck _can be_ wrong when status is `Delivered` or `Cancelled`
    - e.g. when user owns a truck but decides to do a quick job; truck is
      correct when `OnJob` but when `Delivered`/`Cancelled` the truck is
      reported as the truck the user owns instead of the one used in the job.

```
{
    "game": "ets2",               // Game type (ets2, ats)
    "status": 1,                  // See "Status" below
    "type": 1,                    // See "Types" below
    "isSpecial": false,           // Is this special transport job
    "income": 6878,               // In game specific units (ETS2: €, ATS: $)
    "revenue": 6878,              // In game specific units (ETS2: €, ATS: $)
    "xp": 120,                    // XP received
    "time": 234,                  // Time spend on the job in game minutes
    "maxSpeed": 0.0,              // Maximum  speed during the delivery (can be negative)
    "fuelConsumed": 0.0,          // Liters
    "autoPark": false,            // Was auto parking used
    "autoLoad": false,            // Was auto loading used (always true for non cargo market jobs)
    "distance": {
        "driven": 0.0,            // Kilometers
        "planned": 248            // Planned trip distance kilometers
    },
    "trailer": {
        "id": "scs_box.moving_floor.chassis_stwx2esii",
        "accessoryId": ""
    },
    "truck": {
        "id": "vehicle.scania.streamline",
        "name": "Streamline",
        "wheels": 6,
        "brand": {
            "id": "scania",
            "name": "Scania"
        }
    },
    "cargo": {
        "id": "paper",
        "name": "Office Paper",
        "mass": 18000.0,          // Kilograms
        "damage": 0.0             // Percentage (e.g. 0.01 = 1%)
    },
    "source": {
        "city": {
            "id": "tampere",
            "name": "Tampere"
        },
        "company": {
            "id": "viljo_paper",
            "name": "Viljo Paperitehdas Oy"
        }
    },
    "destination": {
        "city": {
            "id": "helsinki",
            "name": "Helsinki"
        },
        "company": {
            "id": "cont_port",
            "name": "Container Port"
        }
    }
}
```

### Status

Description of job status:

```
0 = FreeAsWind
1 = OnJob
2 = Cancelled
3 = Delivered
```

**Note:** Job with a status `0` should not ever be sent to the API, if that
happens it's a bug.

### Types

Description of job types:

```
0 = Unknown
1 = CargoMarket
2 = QuickJob
3 = FreightMarket
4 = ExternalContract
5 = ExternalMarket
```

**Note:** If job has status of `0` it's most likely bug and an Issue should
be opened if there is no open issue of it already.

## Truck

Trucks positional data will be sent to `<API_URL>/truck` once in a second only
if game is not paused.

Response code is ignored; payload is only sent once.

Below is an example of JSON format for a truck positional data.

```
{
    "speed": 0.0,                 // Meters per second
    "heading": 0.723,
    "x": 34496.559,
    "y": 11.938,
    "z": -61094.948
}
```

## Fine

When player receives a fine it will be sent to `<API_URL>/fine`. Fines will be
sent to the API even when player does not have an active job.

Expected response code `200`.

Below is an example of JSON format for fine:

```
{
    "type": 1,                    // Explanation below
    "amount": 370                 // Fine offence amount in native game currency
}
```

Valid `Types` are:

```
0  = Unknown
1  = Crash
2  = AvoidSleeping
3  = WrongWay
4  = SpeedingCamera
5  = NoLights
6  = RedSignal
7  = Speeding
8  = AvoidWeighing
9  = IllegalTrailer
10 = AvoidInspection
11 = IllegalBorderCrossing
12 = HardShoulderViolation
13 = DamagedVehicleUsage
14 = Generic
```

If API receives fine with type `Unknown` then create an issue (if it does not
exist yet) as it could indicate game has a new fine type.
