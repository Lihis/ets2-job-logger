# User Guide

This document tries to cover necessary information for an application user.

## Usage

This application can be used with any service provider (e.g. VTC) which has
support for it.

On first start after installation configuration needs to be set, refer to
[Settings](#Settings) section for information of the settings.

Otherwise, all what you need to do is to start the application before you
start playing and keep it running until you stop.

**Note:** Currently it is assumed that jobs are always delivered in one go,
i.e. game is not closed in the middle of the delivery.

## Settings
